    "# Python and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When people begin programming, it's natural to think procedurally, to tell the computer what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do one thing\n",
    "2. Do the next thing\n",
    "3. Do the third thing\n",
    "\n",
    "This works for simple applications, but it does not scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires us to understand, in our heads, every step the computer should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do things more complicated than we can keep in our heads at once, we need to break things down into component parts. Object Oriented Programming is a design pattern to do just that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding State\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand object-oriented programming, it's important first to understand the term **state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of state as \"state of the world.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a data transformation pipeline. Your state consists of the data itself. At any given time, your data might be in any number of states between \"fresh and useless\" and \"just-the-way-you-want-it.\" If your data comes in separate bits, each bit must be in the right state before it is combined with other bits, which then create new state. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we keep track of all this state, when it becomes to complex to do procedurally? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming seeks to split the state of the world into individual \"objects,\" which are both responsible for keeping track of their own state, and also responsible for knowing how to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "O-O reflects nature:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the forest, with all its animals. No one individual keeps track of each fox in the forest: how much fur they have, how much they have eaten, how thirsty they are, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each fox is in charge of itself. Nobody can put food in the foxes belly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other feature of the foxes of the forest: they are all alike in their technical inner workings (they have the same type of stomach, same type of mouth). But they might be in a different state at any given moment (one might be hungry, one might be full).\n",
    "\n",
    "In O-O programming, we reflect this pattern via \"classes\" and \"instances\". \"Fox\" is a class. Each fox in the forest, is an \"instance\" of the \"Fox\" class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming becomes really powerful via polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, consider all the animals in the forest. There are many different kind of animals! But say I want to go through the forest and give them all water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I don't need to know the details of how their stomachs work and how the water goes from their mouths to the rest of their bodies. I just need to give water over to them, and let them take care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is single-dispatch polymorphism!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in O-O programming, ojects are both responsible for keeping track of their own state, and also responsible for knowing how to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Changing state,\" in all the programming we've seen, is done via functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In O-O programming, we have special functions called \"methods\".\n",
    "\n",
